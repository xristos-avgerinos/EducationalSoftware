# EducationalSoftware
A web MVC ASP.NET App project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of "Educational Software".

The team was asked to implement a website, aimed at the professional orientation of students and graduates of IT departments. The students after logging into 
their account with their personal data will have the opportunity to learn about all 6 directions given, to be assessed for each direction by
completing the representative questionnaire as well as a follow-up questionnaire for all the directions.

In addition, after completing the training of each direction, they will be able to see recommendations for them, i.e. career paths related to Informatics and
appropriate postgraduate studies based on a minor recommendation subsystem that will work by collecting information about the
learners (such as grades in courses to be entered by him) and
their preferences through another questionnaire.

 **Group members involved in this project:**<br>
 Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
